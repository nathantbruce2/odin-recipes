Project HTML

This project is about giving myself exposure to HTML and being confident in my abilities to be able to use the tags within the program to structure my webpage. I also would like to be able to gain confidence using the terminal and the command line to optimise my coding experience, as well as committing at milestones to ensure there is a steady progression without losing vital code.

Steak page finished and working

Used different html tags to successfullly structure the steak recipe. I did have an issue with using the a tag instead of img for the photo, but rectified that mistake.
